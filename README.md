# comproDLS ES6 | Seed

Boilerplate for producing front-end libraries and Nodejs modules (Input: ES6, Output: universal library)

* Webpack 3 
* ES6 as a source.
* Exports in a [umd](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) format so your library works in browser and Nodejs (serverside)
* ES6 test setup with [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](http://chaijs.com/).
* Linting with [ESLint](http://eslint.org/).

## Build Process

```
ES6 source files
       |
       |
    webpack
       |
       +--- babel, eslint
       |
  ready to use
     library
  in umd format
```

*Have in mind that you have to build your library before publishing. The files under the `lib` folder are the ones that should be distributed.*

## Using the SEED for your own Library/Module

1. Setting up the name of your library
  * Open `webpack.config.js` file and change the value of `libraryName` variable.
  * Open `package.json` file and change the value of `main` property so it matches the name of your library.
2. Build your library
  * Run `npm install` to get the project's dependencies
  * Run `npm run build` to produce minified version of your library.
3. Development mode
  * Having all the dependencies installed run `npm run dev`. This command will generate an non-minified version of your library and will run a watcher so you get the compilation on file change.
4. Running the tests
  * Run `npm run test`

## Commands

* `npm run build` - produces production version of your library under the `lib` folder
* `npm run dev` - produces development version of your library and runs a watcher
* `npm run test` - well ... it runs the tests :)
* `npm run test:watch` - same as above but in a watch mode

## Linking ES5 Depedencies (legacy libraries)

An example of using non ES6 dependencies that shouldn’t be resolved by webpack (babel), but should become dependencies of the resulting bundle. In the following example we are excluding React and Lodash:

```js
{
  devtool: 'source-map',
  output: {
    path: '...',
    libraryTarget: 'umd',
    library: '...'
  },
  entry: '...',
  ...
  externals: {
    react: 'react'
    // Use more complicated mapping for lodash.
    // We need to access it differently depending
    // on the environment.
    lodash: {
      commonjs: 'lodash',
      commonjs2: 'lodash',
      amd: '_',
      root: '_'
    }
  }
}
```
